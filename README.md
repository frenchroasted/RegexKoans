Regular Expression Koans
========================

A series of tutorials on Regular Expressions.

Learn how to write, read, and use Regular Expressions by completing or correcting
code to make failing Unit Tests pass. Each Koan includes a series of Unit Tests
which illustrate Regular Expression principles and techniques. I have made an effort
to avoid making forward references in the tutorial sequence, but there are enough
back references to earlier Koans that it would be best to complete the Koans in
the order presented.

Javascript's Regular Expression engine is very similar to that of many other
programming languages. It differs only in esoteric details and in that it does
not support Lookbehind Assertions, which are consequently not covered in this tutorial.
For an [excellent summary of Javascript's Regex capabilities][jsRegex]
as well as those of many other languages, Jan Goyvaerts is your first and last resource.

To practice, to try out some code before using it in your program, or just to play around,
[rubular.com][rubular] is a fantastic Regular Expression resource.
It uses Ruby's Regex engine, but the differences are minor. This web tool should be in the
Bookmarks list of every programmer.
